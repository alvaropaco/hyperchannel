It helps to instantiate, initialize and coordinate the many\n    objects that make up your app.\n  \n    Each Ember app has one and only one `Application` object. In fact, the\n    very first thing you should do in your application is create the instance:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import Application from '@ember/application';\n  \n    window.App = Application.create();\n    ```\n  \n    Typically, the application object is the only global variable. All other\n    classes in your app should be properties on the `Application` instance,\n    which highlights its first role: a global namespace.\n  \n    For example, if you define a view class, it might look like this:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import Application from '@ember/application';\n  \n    App.MyView = Ember.View.extend();\n    ```\n  \n    By default, calling `Application.create()` will automatically initialize\n    your application by calling the `Application.initialize()` method. If\n    you need to delay initialization, you can call your app's `deferReadiness()`\n    method. When you are ready for your app to be initialized, call its\n    `advanceReadiness()` method.\n  \n    You can define a `ready` method on the `Application` instance, which\n    will be run by Ember when the application is initialized.\n  \n    Because `Application` inherits from `Ember.Namespace`, any classes\n    you create will have useful string representations when calling `toString()`.\n    See the `Ember.Namespace` documentation for more information.\n  \n    While you can think of your `Application` as a container that holds the\n    other classes in your application, there are several other responsibilities\n    going on under-the-hood that you may want to understand.\n  \n    ### Event Delegation\n  \n    Ember uses a technique called _event delegation_. This allows the framework\n    to set up a global, shared event listener instead of requiring each view to\n    do it manually. For example, instead of each view registering its own\n    `mousedown` listener on its associated element, Ember sets up a `mousedown`\n    listener on the `body`.\n  \n    If a `mousedown` event occurs, Ember will look at the target of the event and\n    start walking up the DOM node tree, finding corresponding views and invoking\n    their `mouseDown` method as it goes.\n  \n    `Application` has a number of default events that it listens for, as\n    well as a mapping from lowercase events to camel-cased view method names. For\n    example, the `keypress` event causes the `keyPress` method on the view to be\n    called, the `dblclick` event causes `doubleClick` to be called, and so on.\n  \n    If there is a bubbling browser event that Ember does not listen for by\n    default, you can specify custom events and their corresponding view method\n    names by setting the application's `customEvents` property:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import Application from '@ember/application';\n  \n    let App = Application.create({\n      customEvents: {\n        // add support for the paste event\n        paste: 'paste'\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    To prevent Ember from setting up a listener for a default event,\n    specify the event name with a `null` value in the `customEvents`\n    property:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import Application from '@ember/application';\n  \n    let App = Application.create({\n      customEvents: {\n        // prevent listeners for mouseenter/mouseleave events\n        mouseenter: null,\n        mouseleave: null\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    By default, the application sets up these event listeners on the document\n    body. However, in cases where you are embedding an Ember application inside\n    an existing page, you may want it to set up the listeners on an element\n    inside the body.\n  \n    For example, if only events inside a DOM element with the ID of `ember-app`\n    should be delegated, set your application's `rootElement` property:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import Application from '@ember/application';\n  \n    let App = Application.create({\n      rootElement: '#ember-app'\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    The `rootElement` can be either a DOM element or a jQuery-compatible selector\n    string. Note that *views appended to the DOM outside the root element will\n    not receive events.* If you specify a custom root element, make sure you only\n    append views inside it!\n  \n    To learn more about the events Ember components use, see\n  \n    [components/handling-events](https://guides.emberjs.com/current/components/handling-events/#toc_event-names).\n  \n    ### Initializers\n  \n    Libraries on top of Ember can add initializers, like so:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import Application from '@ember/application';\n  \n    Application.initializer({\n      name: 'api-adapter',\n  \n      initialize: function(application) {\n        application.register('api-adapter:main', ApiAdapter);\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Initializers provide an opportunity to access the internal registry, which\n    organizes the different components of an Ember application. Additionally\n    they provide a chance to access the instantiated application. Beyond\n    being used for libraries, initializers are also a great way to organize\n    dependency injection or setup in your own application.\n  \n    ### Routing\n  \n    In addition to creating your application's router, `Application` is\n    also responsible for telling the router when to start routing. Transitions\n    between routes can be logged with the `LOG_TRANSITIONS` flag, and more\n    detailed intra-transition logging can be logged with\n    the `LOG_TRANSITIONS_INTERNAL` flag:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import Application from '@ember/application';\n  \n    let App = Application.create({\n      LOG_TRANSITIONS: true, // basic logging of successful transitions\n      LOG_TRANSITIONS_INTERNAL: true // detailed logging of all routing steps\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    By default, the router will begin trying to translate the current URL into\n    application state once the browser emits the `DOMContentReady` event. If you\n    need to defer routing, you can call the application's `deferReadiness()`\n    method. Once routing can begin, call the `advanceReadiness()` method.\n  \n    If there is any setup required before routing begins, you can implement a\n    `ready()` method on your app that will be invoked immediately before routing\n    begins.\n  \n    @class Application\n    @extends Engine\n    @uses RegistryProxyMixin\n    @public\n  */\n\n  var Application = _engine.default.extend({\n    /**\n      The root DOM element of the Application.

controllers.\n    \n      ### Passing functions with the action helper\n    \n      There are three contexts an action helper can be used in. The first two\n      contexts to discuss are attribute context, and Handlebars value context.\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{! An example of attribute context }}\n      <div onclick={{action \"save\"}}></div>\n      {{! Examples of Handlebars value context }}\n      {{input on-input=(action \"save\")}}\n      {{yield (action \"refreshData\") andAnotherParam}}\n      ```\n    \n      In these contexts,\n      the helper is called a \"closure action\" helper. Its behavior is simple:\n      If passed a function name, read that function off the `actions` property\n      of the current context. Once that function is read (or if a function was\n      passed), create a closure over that function and any arguments.\n      The resulting value of an action helper used this way is simply a function.\n    \n      For example, in the attribute context:\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{! An example of attribute context }}\n      <div onclick={{action \"save\"}}></div>\n      ```\n    \n      The resulting template render logic would be:\n    \n      ```js\n      var div = document.createElement('div');\n      var actionFunction = (function(context){\n        return function() {\n          return context.actions.save.apply(context, arguments);\n        };\n      })(context);\n      div.onclick = actionFunction;\n      ```\n    \n      Thus when the div is clicked, the action on that context is called.\n      Because the `actionFunction` is just a function, closure actions can be\n      passed between components and still execute in the correct context.\n    \n      Here is an example action handler on a component:\n    \n      ```app/components/my-component.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        actions: {\n          save() {\n            this.get('model').save();\n          }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Actions are always looked up on the `actions` property of the current context.\n      This avoids collisions in the naming of common actions, such as `destroy`.\n      Two options can be passed to the `action` helper when it is used in this way.\n    \n      * `target=someProperty` will look to `someProperty` instead of the current\n        context for the `actions` hash. This can be useful when targeting a\n        service for actions.\n      * `value=\"target.value\"` will read the path `target.value` off the first\n        argument to the action when it is called and rewrite the first argument\n        to be that value. This is useful when attaching actions to event listeners.\n    \n      ### Invoking an action\n    \n      Closure actions curry both their scope and any arguments. When invoked, any\n      additional arguments are added to the already curried list.\n      Actions should be invoked using the [sendAction](/api/ember/release/classes/Component/methods/sendAction?anchor=sendAction)\n      method. The first argument to `sendAction` is the action to be called, and\n      additional arguments are passed to the action function. This has interesting\n      properties combined with currying of arguments. For example:\n    \n      ```app/components/my-component.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        actions: {\n          // Usage {{input on-input=(action (action 'setName' model) value=\"target.value\")}}\n          setName(model, name) {\n            model.set('name', name);\n          }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      The first argument (`model`) was curried over, and the run-time argument (`event`)\n      becomes a second argument. Action calls can be nested this way because each simply\n      returns a function. Any function can be passed to the `{{action}}` helper, including\n      other actions.\n    \n      Actions invoked with `sendAction` have the same currying behavior as demonstrated\n      with `on-input` above. For example:\n    \n      ```app/components/my-input.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        actions: {\n          setName(model, name) {\n            model.set('name', name);\n          }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{my-input submit=(action 'setName' model)}}\n      ```\n    \n      ```app/components/my-component.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        click() {\n          // Note that model is not passed, it was curried in the template\n          this.sendAction('submit', 'bob');\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      ### Attaching actions to DOM elements\n    \n      The third context of the `{{action}}` helper can be called \"element space\".\n      For example:\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{! An example of element space }}\n      <div {{action \"save\"}}></div>\n      ```\n    \n      Used this way, the `{{action}}` helper provides a useful shortcut for\n      registering an HTML element in a template for a single DOM event and\n      forwarding that interaction to the template's context (controller or component).\n      If the context of a template is a controller, actions used this way will\n      bubble to routes when the controller does not implement the specified action.\n      Once an action hits a route, it will bubble through the route hierarchy.\n    \n      ### Event Propagation\n    \n      `{{action}}` helpers called in element space can control event bubbling. Note\n      that the closure style actions cannot.\n    \n      Events triggered through the action helper will automatically have\n      `.preventDefault()` called on them. You do not need to do so in your event\n      handlers. If you need to allow event propagation (to handle file inputs for\n      example) you can supply the `preventDefault=false` option to the `{{action}}` helper:\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      <div {{action \"sayHello\" preventDefault=false}}>\n        <input type=\"file\" />\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" />\n      </div>\n      ```\n    \n      To disable bubbling, pass `bubbles=false` to the helper:\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      <button {{action 'edit' post bubbles=false}}>Edit</button>\n      ```\n    \n      To disable bubbling with closure style actions you must create your own\n      wrapper helper that makes use of `event.stopPropagation()`:\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      <div onclick={{disable-bubbling (action \"sayHello\")}}>Hello</div>\n      ```\n    \n      ```app/helpers/disable-bubbling.js\n      import { helper } from '@ember/component/helper';\n    \n      export function disableBubbling([action]) {\n        return function(event) {\n          event.stopPropagation();\n          return action(event);\n        };\n      }\n      export default helper(disableBubbling);\n      ```\n    \n      If you need the default handler to trigger you should either register your\n      own event handler, or use event methods on your view class. See\n      [\"Responding to Browser Events\"](/api/ember/release/classes/Component)\n      in the documentation for `Component` for more information.\n    \n      ### Specifying DOM event type\n    \n      `{{action}}` helpers called in element space can specify an event type.\n      By default the `{{action}}` helper registers for DOM `click` events. You can\n      supply an `on` option to the helper to specify a different DOM event name:\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      <div {{action \"anActionName\" on=\"doubleClick\"}}>\n        click me\n      </div>\n      ```\n    \n      See [\"Event Names\"](/api/ember/release/classes/Component) for a list of\n      acceptable DOM event names.\n    \n      ### Specifying whitelisted modifier keys\n    \n      `{{action}}` helpers called in element space can specify modifier keys.\n      By default the `{{action}}` helper will ignore click events with pressed modifier\n      keys. You can supply an `allowedKeys` option to specify which keys should not be ignored.\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      <div {{action \"anActionName\" allowedKeys=\"alt\"}}>\n        click me\n      </div>\n      ```\n    \n      This way the action will fire when clicking with the alt key pressed down.\n      Alternatively, supply \"any\" to the `allowedKeys` option to accept any combination of modifier keys.\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      <div {{action \"anActionName\" allowedKeys=\"any\"}}>\n        click me with any key pressed\n      </div>\n      ```\n    \n      ### Specifying a Target\n    \n      A `target` option can be provided to the helper to change\n      which object will receive the method call. This option must be a path\n      to an object, accessible in the current context:\n    \n      ```app/templates/application.hbs\n      <div {{action \"anActionName\" target=someService}}>\n        click me\n      </div>\n      ```\n    \n      ```app/controllers/application.js\n      import Controller from '@ember/controller';\n      import { inject as service } from '@ember/service';\n    \n      export default Controller.extend({\n        someService: service()\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      @method action\n      @for Ember.Templates.helpers\n      @public\n    */\n\n    function NOOP(args) {\n        return args;\n    }\n    function makeArgsProcessor(valuePathRef, actionArgsRef) {\n        var mergeArgs = void 0;\n        if (actionArgsRef.length > 0) {\n            mergeArgs = function (args) {\n                return actionArgsRef.map(function (ref) {\n                    return ref.value();\n                }).concat(args);\n            };\n        }\n        var readValue = void 0;\n        if (valuePathRef) {\n            readValue = function (args) {\n                var valuePath = valuePathRef.value();\n                if (valuePath && args.length > 0) {\n                    args[0] = (0, _emberMetal.get)(args[0], valuePath);\n                }\n                return args;\n            };\n        }\n        if (mergeArgs && readValue) {\n            return function (args) {\n                return readValue(mergeArgs(args));\n            };\n        } else {\n            return mergeArgs || readValue || NOOP;\n        }\n    }\n    function makeDynamicClosureAction(context, targetRef, actionRef, processArgs, debugKey) {\n        return function () {\n            return makeClosureAction(context, targetRef.value(), actionRef.value(), processArgs, debugKey).apply(undefined, arguments);\n        };\n    }\n    function makeClosureAction(context, target, action, processArgs, debugKey) {\n        var self = void 0,\n            typeofAction;\n        var fn = void 0;\n        false && !!(0, _emberMetal.isNone)(action) && (0, _emberDebug.assert)('Action passed is null or undefined in (action) from ' + target + '.', !(0, _emberMetal.isNone)(action));\n\n        if (typeof action[INVOKE] === 'function') {\n            self = action;\n            fn = action[INVOKE];\n        } else {\n            typeofAction = typeof action;\n\n            if (typeofAction === 'string') {\n                self = target;\n                fn = target.actions && target.actions[action];\n                false && !fn && (0, _emberDebug.assert)('An action named \\'' + action + '\\' was not found in ' + target, fn);\n            } else if (typeofAction === 'function') {\n                self = context;\n                fn = action;\n            } else {\n                false && !false && (0, _emberDebug.assert)('An action could not be made for `' + (debugKey || action) + '` in ' + target + '.

Properties accessed in its templates go\n      to the view object and actions are targeted at\n      the view object. There is no access to the\n      surrounding context or outer controller; all\n      contextual information must be passed in.\n    \n      The easiest way to create a `Component` is via\n      a template. If you name a template\n      `app/components/my-foo.hbs`, you will be able to use\n      `{{my-foo}}` in other templates, which will make\n      an instance of the isolated component.\n    \n      ```app/components/my-foo.hbs\n      {{person-profile person=currentUser}}\n      ```\n    \n      ```app/components/person-profile.hbs\n      <h1>{{person.title}}</h1>\n      <img src={{person.avatar}}>\n      <p class='signature'>{{person.signature}}</p>\n      ```\n    \n      You can use `yield` inside a template to\n      include the **contents** of any block attached to\n      the component. The block will be executed in the\n      context of the surrounding context or outer controller:\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{#person-profile person=currentUser}}\n        <p>Admin mode</p>\n        {{! Executed in the controller's context. }}\n      {{/person-profile}}\n      ```\n    \n      ```app/components/person-profile.hbs\n      <h1>{{person.title}}</h1>\n      {{! Executed in the component's context. }}\n      {{yield}} {{! block contents }}\n      ```\n    \n      If you want to customize the component, in order to\n      handle events or actions, you implement a subclass\n      of `Component` named after the name of the\n      component.\n    \n      For example, you could implement the action\n      `hello` for the `person-profile` component:\n    \n      ```app/components/person-profile.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        actions: {\n          hello(name) {\n            console.log(\"Hello\", name);\n          }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      And then use it in the component's template:\n    \n      ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs\n      <h1>{{person.title}}</h1>\n      {{yield}} <!-- block contents -->\n      <button {{action 'hello' person.name}}>\n        Say Hello to {{person.name}}\n      </button>\n      ```\n    \n      Components must have a `-` in their name to avoid\n      conflicts with built-in controls that wrap HTML\n      elements. This is consistent with the same\n      requirement in web components.\n    \n      ## HTML Tag\n    \n      The default HTML tag name used for a component's DOM representation is `div`.\n      This can be customized by setting the `tagName` property.\n      The following component class:\n    \n      ```app/components/emphasized-paragraph.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        tagName: 'em'\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Would result in instances with the following HTML:\n    \n      ```html\n      <em id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\"></em>\n      ```\n    \n      ## HTML `class` Attribute\n    \n      The HTML `class` attribute of a component's tag can be set by providing a\n      `classNames` property that is set to an array of strings:\n    \n      ```app/components/my-widget.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        classNames: ['my-class', 'my-other-class']\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Will result in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n    \n      ```html\n      <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view my-class my-other-class\"></div>\n      ```\n    \n      `class` attribute values can also be set by providing a `classNameBindings`\n      property set to an array of properties names for the component. The return value\n      of these properties will be added as part of the value for the components's `class`\n      attribute. These properties can be computed properties:\n    \n      ```app/components/my-widget.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n      import { computed } from '@ember/object';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        classNameBindings: ['propertyA', 'propertyB'],\n    \n        propertyA: 'from-a',\n        propertyB: computed(function() {\n          if (someLogic) { return 'from-b'; }\n        })\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Will result in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n    \n      ```html\n      <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view from-a from-b\"></div>\n      ```\n    \n      If the value of a class name binding returns a boolean the property name\n      itself will be used as the class name if the property is true.\n      The class name will not be added if the value is `false` or `undefined`.\n    \n      ```app/components/my-widget.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        classNameBindings: ['hovered'],\n    \n        hovered: true\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Will result in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n    \n      ```html\n      <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view hovered\"></div>\n      ```\n    \n      When using boolean class name bindings you can supply a string value other\n      than the property name for use as the `class` HTML attribute by appending the\n      preferred value after a \":\" character when defining the binding:\n    \n      ```app/components/my-widget.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        classNameBindings: ['awesome:so-very-cool'],\n    \n        awesome: true\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Will result in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n    \n      ```html\n      <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view so-very-cool\"></div>\n      ```\n    \n      Boolean value class name bindings whose property names are in a\n      camelCase-style format will be converted to a dasherized format:\n    \n      ```app/components/my-widget.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        classNameBindings: ['isUrgent'],\n    \n        isUrgent: true\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Will result in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n    \n      ```html\n      <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view is-urgent\"></div>\n      ```\n    \n      Class name bindings can also refer to object values that are found by\n      traversing a path relative to the component itself:\n    \n      ```app/components/my-widget.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n      import EmberObject from '@ember/object';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        classNameBindings: ['messages.empty'],\n    \n        messages: EmberObject.create({\n          empty: true\n        })\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Will result in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n    \n      ```html\n      <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view empty\"></div>\n      ```\n    \n      If you want to add a class name for a property which evaluates to true and\n      and a different class name if it evaluates to false, you can pass a binding\n      like this:\n    \n      ```app/components/my-widget.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        classNameBindings: ['isEnabled:enabled:disabled'],\n        isEnabled: true\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Will result in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n    \n      ```html\n      <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view enabled\"></div>\n      ```\n    \n      When isEnabled is `false`, the resulting HTML representation looks like\n      this:\n    \n      ```html\n      <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view disabled\"></div>\n      ```\n    \n      This syntax offers the convenience to add a class if a property is `false`:\n    \n      ```app/components/my-widget.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n    \n      // Applies no class when isEnabled is true and class 'disabled' when isEnabled is false\n      export default Component.extend({\n        classNameBindings: ['isEnabled::disabled'],\n        isEnabled: true\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Will result in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n    \n      ```html\n      <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\"></div>\n      ```\n    \n      When the `isEnabled` property on the component is set to `false`, it will result\n      in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n    \n      ```html\n      <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view disabled\"></div>\n      ```\n    \n      Updates to the value of a class name binding will result in automatic\n      update of the  HTML `class` attribute in the component's rendered HTML\n      representation. If the value becomes `false` or `undefined` the class name\n      will be removed.\n      Both `classNames` and `classNameBindings` are concatenated properties. See\n      [EmberObject](/api/ember/release/classes/EmberObject) documentation for more\n      information about concatenated properties.\n    \n      ## HTML Attributes\n    \n      The HTML attribute section of a component's tag can be set by providing an\n      `attributeBindings` property set to an array of property names on the component.\n      The return value of these properties will be used as the value of the component's\n      HTML associated attribute:\n    \n      ```app/components/my-anchor.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        tagName: 'a',\n        attributeBindings: ['href'],\n    \n        href: 'http://google.com'\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Will result in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n    \n      ```html\n      <a id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\" href=\"http://google.com\"></a>\n      ```\n    \n      One property can be mapped on to another by placing a \":\" between\n      the source property and the destination property:\n    \n      ```app/components/my-anchor.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        tagName: 'a',\n        attributeBindings: ['url:href'],\n    \n        url: 'http://google.com'\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Will result in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n    \n      ```html\n      <a id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\" href=\"http://google.com\"></a>\n      ```\n    \n      Namespaced attributes (e.g. `xlink:href`) are supported, but have to be\n      mapped, since `:` is not a valid character for properties in Javascript:\n    \n      ```app/components/my-use.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        tagName: 'use',\n        attributeBindings: ['xlinkHref:xlink:href'],\n    \n        xlinkHref: '#triangle'\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Will result in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n    \n      ```html\n      <use xlink:href=\"#triangle\"></use>\n      ```\n    \n      If the return value of an `attributeBindings` monitored property is a boolean\n      the attribute will be present or absent depending on the value:\n    \n      ```app/components/my-text-input.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        tagName: 'input',\n        attributeBindings: ['disabled'],\n    \n        disabled: false\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Will result in a component instance with an HTML representation of:\n    \n      ```html\n      <input id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\" />\n      ```\n    \n      `attributeBindings` can refer to computed properties:\n    \n      ```app/components/my-text-input.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n      import { computed } from '@ember/object';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        tagName: 'input',\n        attributeBindings: ['disabled'],\n    \n        disabled: computed(function() {\n          if (someLogic) {\n            return true;\n          } else {\n            return false;\n          }\n        })\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      To prevent setting an attribute altogether, use `null` or `undefined` as the\n      return value of the `attributeBindings` monitored property:\n    \n      ```app/components/my-text-input.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        tagName: 'form',\n        attributeBindings: ['novalidate'],\n        novalidate: null\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Updates to the property of an attribute binding will result in automatic\n      update of the  HTML attribute in the component's rendered HTML representation.\n      `attributeBindings` is a concatenated property. See [EmberObject](/api/ember/release/classes/EmberObject)\n      documentation for more information about concatenated properties.\n    \n      ## Layouts\n    \n      See [Ember.Templates.helpers.yield](/api/ember/release/classes/Ember.Templates.helpers/methods/yield?anchor=yield)\n      for more information.\n    \n      Layout can be used to wrap content in a component. In addition\n      to wrapping content in a Component's template, you can also use\n      the public layout API in your Component JavaScript.\n    \n      ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs\n        <h1>Person's Title</h1>\n        <div class='details'>{{yield}}</div>\n      ```\n    \n      ```app/components/person-profile.js\n        import Component from '@ember/component';\n        import layout from '../templates/components/person-profile';\n    \n        export default Component.extend({\n          layout\n        });\n      ```\n    \n      The above will result in the following HTML output:\n    \n      ```html\n        <h1>Person's Title</h1>\n        <div class=\"details\">\n          <h2>Chief Basket Weaver</h2>\n          <h3>Fisherman Industries</h3>\n        </div>\n      ```\n    \n      ## Responding to Browser Events\n    \n      Components can respond to user-initiated events in one of three ways: method\n      implementation, through an event manager, and through `{{action}}` helper use\n      in their template or layout.\n    \n      ### Method Implementation\n    \n      Components can respond to user-initiated events by implementing a method that\n      matches the event name. A `jQuery.Event` object will be passed as the\n      argument to this method.\n    \n      ```app/components/my-widget.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        click(event) {\n          // will be called when an instance's\n          // rendered element is clicked\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      ### `{{action}}` Helper\n    \n      See [Ember.Templates.helpers.action](/api/ember/release/classes/Ember.Templates.helpers/methods/yield?anchor=yield).\n    \n      ### Event Names\n    \n      All of the event handling approaches described above respond to the same set\n      of events. The names of the built-in events are listed below. (The hash of\n      built-in events exists in `Ember.EventDispatcher`.)

Type into\n      either text area box and they'll both stay in sync. Note that\n      `alias` costs more in terms of performance, so only use it when\n      your really binding in both directions:\n    \n      ```app/controllers/application.js\n      import Controller from '@ember/controller';\n      import { alias } from '@ember/object/computed';\n    \n      export default Controller.extend({\n        writtenWords: \"Lots of text that IS bound\",\n    \n        twoWayWrittenWords: alias(\"writtenWords\")\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{textarea value=writtenWords}}\n      {{textarea value=twoWayWrittenWords}}\n      ```\n    \n      ```html\n      <textarea id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-text-area\">\n        Lots of text that IS bound\n      </textarea>\n      <-- both updated in real time -->\n      <textarea id=\"ember2\" class=\"ember-text-area\">\n        Lots of text that IS bound\n      </textarea>\n      ```\n    \n      ### Actions\n    \n      The helper can send multiple actions based on user events.\n      The action property defines the action which is send when\n      the user presses the return key.\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{input action=\"submit\"}}\n      ```\n    \n      The helper allows some user events to send actions.\n    \n      * `enter`\n      * `insert-newline`\n      * `escape-press`\n      * `focus-in`\n      * `focus-out`\n      * `key-press`\n    \n      For example, if you desire an action to be sent when the input is blurred,\n      you only need to setup the action name to the event name property.\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{textarea focus-out=\"alertMessage\"}}\n      ```\n    \n      See more about [Text Support Actions](/api/ember/release/classes/TextArea)\n    \n      ### Extension\n    \n      Internally, `{{textarea}}` creates an instance of `TextArea`, passing\n      arguments from the helper to `TextArea`'s `create` method. You can\n      extend the capabilities of text areas in your application by reopening this\n      class. For example, if you are building a Bootstrap project where `data-*`\n      attributes are used, you can globally add support for a `data-*` attribute\n      on all `{{textarea}}`s' in your app by reopening `TextArea` or\n      `TextSupport` and adding it to the `attributeBindings` concatenated\n      property:\n    \n      ```javascript\n      import TextArea from '@ember/component/text-area';\n    \n      TextArea.reopen({\n        attributeBindings: ['data-error']\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Keep in mind when writing `TextArea` subclasses that `TextArea`\n      itself extends `Component`.

This can\n      be overridden for a single use of `{{link-to}}` by supplying\n      a `tagName` option:\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{#link-to 'photoGallery' tagName=\"li\"}}\n        Great Hamster Photos\n      {{/link-to}}\n      ```\n    \n      ```html\n      <li>\n        Great Hamster Photos\n      </li>\n      ```\n    \n      To override this option for your entire application, see\n      \"Overriding Application-wide Defaults\".\n    \n      ### Disabling the `link-to` component\n      By default `{{link-to}}` is enabled.\n      any passed value to the `disabled` component property will disable\n      the `link-to` component.\n    \n      static use: the `disabled` option:\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{#link-to 'photoGallery' disabled=true}}\n        Great Hamster Photos\n      {{/link-to}}\n      ```\n    \n      dynamic use: the `disabledWhen` option:\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{#link-to 'photoGallery' disabledWhen=controller.someProperty}}\n        Great Hamster Photos\n      {{/link-to}}\n      ```\n    \n      any truthy value passed to `disabled` will disable it except `undefined`.\n    \n      See \"Overriding Application-wide Defaults\" for more.\n    \n      ### Handling `href`\n      `{{link-to}}` will use your application's Router to\n      fill the element's `href` property with a url that\n      matches the path to the supplied `routeName` for your\n      router's configured `Location` scheme, which defaults\n      to HashLocation.\n    \n      ### Handling current route\n      `{{link-to}}` will apply a CSS class name of 'active'\n      when the application's current route matches\n      the supplied routeName. For example, if the application's\n      current route is 'photoGallery.recent' the following\n      use of `{{link-to}}`:\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{#link-to 'photoGallery.recent'}}\n        Great Hamster Photos\n      {{/link-to}}\n      ```\n    \n      will result in\n    \n      ```html\n      <a href=\"/hamster-photos/this-week\" class=\"active\">\n        Great Hamster Photos\n      </a>\n      ```\n    \n      The CSS class name used for active classes can be customized\n      for a single use of `{{link-to}}` by passing an `activeClass`\n      option:\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{#link-to 'photoGallery.recent' activeClass=\"current-url\"}}\n        Great Hamster Photos\n      {{/link-to}}\n      ```\n    \n      ```html\n      <a href=\"/hamster-photos/this-week\" class=\"current-url\">\n        Great Hamster Photos\n      </a>\n      ```\n    \n      To override this option for your entire application, see\n      \"Overriding Application-wide Defaults\".\n    \n      ### Keeping a link active for other routes\n    \n      If you need a link to be 'active' even when it doesn't match\n      the current route, you can use the `current-when` argument.\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{#link-to 'photoGallery' current-when='photos'}}\n        Photo Gallery\n      {{/link-to}}\n      ```\n    \n      This may be helpful for keeping links active for:\n    \n      * non-nested routes that are logically related\n      * some secondary menu approaches\n      * 'top navigation' with 'sub navigation' scenarios\n    \n      A link will be active if `current-when` is `true` or the current\n      route is the route this link would transition to.\n    \n      To match multiple routes 'space-separate' the routes:\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{#link-to 'gallery' current-when='photos drawings paintings'}}\n        Art Gallery\n      {{/link-to}}\n      ```\n    \n      ### Supplying a model\n      An optional model argument can be used for routes whose\n      paths contain dynamic segments. This argument will become\n      the model context of the linked route:\n    \n      ```javascript\n      Router.map(function() {\n        this.route(\"photoGallery\", {path: \"hamster-photos/:photo_id\"});\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{#link-to 'photoGallery' aPhoto}}\n        {{aPhoto.title}}\n      {{/link-to}}\n      ```\n    \n      ```html\n      <a href=\"/hamster-photos/42\">\n        Tomster\n      </a>\n      ```\n    \n      ### Supplying multiple models\n      For deep-linking to route paths that contain multiple\n      dynamic segments, multiple model arguments can be used.\n      As the router transitions through the route path, each\n      supplied model argument will become the context for the\n      route with the dynamic segments:\n    \n      ```javascript\n      Router.map(function() {\n        this.route(\"photoGallery\", { path: \"hamster-photos/:photo_id\" }, function() {\n          this.route(\"comment\", {path: \"comments/:comment_id\"});\n        });\n      });\n      ```\n      This argument will become the model context of the linked route:\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{#link-to 'photoGallery.comment' aPhoto comment}}\n        {{comment.body}}\n      {{/link-to}}\n      ```\n    \n      ```html\n      <a href=\"/hamster-photos/42/comments/718\">\n        A+++ would snuggle again.\n      </a>\n      ```\n    \n      ### Supplying an explicit dynamic segment value\n      If you don't have a model object available to pass to `{{link-to}}`,\n      an optional string or integer argument can be passed for routes whose\n      paths contain dynamic segments. This argument will become the value\n      of the dynamic segment:\n    \n      ```javascript\n      Router.map(function() {\n        this.route(\"photoGallery\", { path: \"hamster-photos/:photo_id\" });\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{#link-to 'photoGallery' aPhotoId}}\n        {{aPhoto.title}}\n      {{/link-to}}\n      ```\n    \n      ```html\n      <a href=\"/hamster-photos/42\">\n        Tomster\n      </a>\n      ```\n    \n      When transitioning into the linked route, the `model` hook will\n      be triggered with parameters including this passed identifier.\n    \n      ### Allowing Default Action\n    \n      By default the `{{link-to}}` component prevents the default browser action\n      by calling `preventDefault()` as this sort of action bubbling is normally\n      handled internally and we do not want to take the browser to a new URL (for\n      example).\n    \n      If you need to override this behavior specify `preventDefault=false` in\n      your template:\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{#link-to 'photoGallery' aPhotoId preventDefault=false}}\n        {{aPhotoId.title}}\n      {{/link-to}}\n      ```\n    \n      ### Overriding attributes\n      You can override any given property of the `LinkComponent`\n      that is generated by the `{{link-to}}` component by passing\n      key/value pairs, like so:\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{#link-to  aPhoto tagName='li' title='Following this link will change your life' classNames='pic sweet'}}\n        Uh-mazing!\n      {{/link-to}}\n      ```\n    \n      See [LinkComponent](/api/ember/release/classes/LinkComponent) for a\n      complete list of overrideable properties. Be sure to also\n      check out inherited properties of `LinkComponent`.\n    \n      ### Overriding Application-wide Defaults\n    \n      ``{{link-to}}`` creates an instance of `LinkComponent` for rendering. To\n      override options for your entire application, export your customized\n      `LinkComponent` from `app/components/link-to.js` with the desired overrides:\n    \n      ```javascript\n      // app/components/link-to.js\n      import LinkComponent from '@ember/routing/link-component';\n    \n      export default LinkComponent.extend({\n        activeClass: \"is-active\",\n        tagName: 'li'\n      })\n      ```\n    \n      It is also possible to override the default event in this manner:\n    \n      ```javascript\n      import LinkCompoennt from '@ember/routing/link-component';\n    \n      export default LinkComponent.extend({\n        eventName: 'customEventName'\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      @method link-to\n      @for Ember.Templates.helpers\n      @param {String} routeName\n      @param {Object} [context]*\n      @param [options] {Object} Handlebars key/value pairs of options, you can override any property of Ember.LinkComponent\n      @return {String} HTML string\n      @see {LinkComponent}\n      @public\n    */\n    /**\n      @module @ember/routing\n    */\n    /**\n      `LinkComponent` renders an element whose `click` event triggers a\n      transition of the application's instance of `Router` to\n      a supplied route by name.\n    \n      `LinkComponent` components are invoked with {{#link-to}}.

By helping Ember\n      detect that some elements in the array are the same, DOM elements can be\n      re-used, significantly improving rendering speed.\n    \n      For example, here's the `{{#each}}` helper with its `key` set to `id`:\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{#each model key=\"id\" as |item|}}\n      {{/each}}\n      ```\n    \n      When this `{{#each}}` re-renders, Ember will match up the previously rendered\n      items (and reorder the generated DOM elements) based on each item's `id`\n      property.\n      By default the item's own reference is used.\n    \n      ### {{else}} condition\n    \n      `{{#each}}` can have a matching `{{else}}`. The contents of this block will render\n      if the collection is empty.\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{#each developers as |person|}}\n        {{person.name}}\n      {{else}}\n        <p>Sorry, nobody is available for this task.</p>\n      {{/each}}\n      ```\n    \n      @method each\n      @for Ember.Templates.helpers\n      @public\n     */\n    /**\n      The `{{each-in}}` helper loops

    When you pass a `readonly` binding from an outer context (e.g. parent component),\n      to to an inner context (e.g. child component), you are saying that changing that\n      property in the inner context does not change the value in the outer context.\n    \n      To specify that a binding is read-only, when invoking the child `Component`:\n    \n      ```app/components/my-parent.js\n      export default Component.extend({\n        totalClicks: 3\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      ```app/templates/components/my-parent.hbs\n      {{log totalClicks}} // -> 3\n      {{my-child

click() {\n          this.incrementProperty('childClickCount');\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      The value updates in the child component, but not the parent component:\n    \n

(e.g. number, string),\n      only the reference to the object is protected using the readonly helper.\n      This means that you can change properties of the object both on the parent component, as well as the child component.\n      The `readonly` binding behaves similar to the `const` keyword in JavaScript.\n    \n      Let's look at an example:\n    \n      First let's set up the parent component:\n    \n      ```app/components/my-parent.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        clicks: null,\n    \n        init() {\n          this._super(...arguments);\n          this.set('clicks', { total: 3 });\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      ```app/templates/components/my-parent.hbs\n      {{log clicks.total}} //-> 3\n      {{my-child childClicks=(readonly clicks)}}\n      ```\n    \n      Now, if you update the `total` property of `childClicks`:\n    \n      ```app/components/my-child.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        click() {\n          this.get('clicks').incrementProperty('total');\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      You will see the following happen:\n    \n      ```app/templates/components/my-parent.hbs\n      {{log clicks.total}} //-> 4\n      {{my-child childClicks=(readonly clicks)}}\n      ```\n    \n      ```app/templates/components/my-child.hbs\n      {{log childClicks.total}} //-> 4\n      ```\n    \n      @method readonly\n      @param {Object} [attr] the read-only attribute.\n      @for

For more info,\n      see the [TextField](/api/ember/release/classes/TextField) docs and\n      the [templates guide](https://emberjs.com/guides/templates/input-helpers/).\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{input value=\"987\"}}\n      ```\n    \n      renders as:\n    \n      ```HTML\n      <input type=\"text\" value=\"987\" />\n      ```\n    \n      ### Text field\n    \n      If no `type` option is specified, a default of type 'text' is used.\n      Many of the standard HTML attributes may be passed to this helper.\n      <table>\n        <tr><td>`readonly`</td><td>`required`</td><td>`autofocus`</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>`value`</td><td>`placeholder`</td><td>`disabled`</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>`size`</td><td>`tabindex`</td><td>`maxlength`</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>`name`</td><td>`min`</td><td>`max`</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>`pattern`</td><td>`accept`</td><td>`autocomplete`</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>`autosave`</td><td>`formaction`</td><td>`formenctype`</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>`formmethod`</td><td>`formnovalidate`</td><td>`formtarget`</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>`height`</td><td>`inputmode`</td><td>`multiple`</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>`step`</td><td>`width`</td><td>`form`</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>`selectionDirection`</td><td>`spellcheck`</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>\n      </table>\n      When set to a quoted string, these values will be directly applied to the HTML\n      element. When left unquoted, these values will be bound to a property on the\n      template's current rendering context (most typically a controller instance).\n      A very common use of this helper is to bind the `value` of an input to an Object's attribute:\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      Search:\n      {{input value=searchWord}}\n      ```\n    \n      In this example, the initial value in the `<input />` will be set to the value of `searchWord`.\n      If the user changes the text, the value of `searchWord` will also be updated.\n    \n      ### Actions\n    \n      The helper can send multiple actions based on user events.\n      The action property defines the action which is sent when\n      the user presses the return key.\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{input action=\"submit\"}}\n      ```\n    \n      The helper allows some user events to send actions.\n    \n      * `enter`\n      * `insert-newline`\n      * `escape-press`\n      * `focus-in`\n      * `focus-out`\n      * `key-press`\n      * `key-up`\n    \n      For example, if you desire an action to be sent when the input is blurred,\n      you only need to setup the action name to the event name property.\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{input focus-out=\"alertMessage\"}}\n      ```\n      See more about [Text Support Actions](/api/ember/release/classes/TextField)\n    \n      ### Extending `TextField`\n    \n      Internally, `{{input type=\"text\"}}` creates an instance of `TextField`, passing\n      arguments from the helper to `TextField`'s `create` method. You can extend the\n      capabilities of text inputs in your applications by reopening this class. For example,\n      if you are building a Bootstrap project where `data-*` attributes are used, you\n      can add one to the `TextField`'s `attributeBindings` property:\n    \n      ```javascript\n      import TextField from '@ember/component/text-field';\n      TextField.reopen({\n        attributeBindings: ['data-error']\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Keep in mind when writing `TextField` subclasses that `TextField`\n      itself extends `Component`. Expect isolated component semantics, not\n      legacy 1.x view semantics (like `controller` being present).\n      See more about [Ember components](/api/ember/release/classes/Component)\n    \n      ### Checkbox\n    \n      Checkboxes are special forms of the `{{input}}` helper.  To create a `<checkbox />`:\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      Emberize Everything:\n      {{input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"isEmberized\" checked=isEmberized}}\n      ```\n    \n      This will bind checked state of this checkbox to the value of `isEmberized`  -- if either one changes,\n      it will be reflected in the other.\n    \n      The following HTML attributes can be set via the helper:\n    \n      * `checked`\n      * `disabled`\n      * `tabindex`\n      * `indeterminate`\n      * `name`\n      * `autofocus`\n      * `form`\n    \n      ### Extending `Checkbox`\n    \n      Internally, `{{input type=\"checkbox\"}}` creates an instance of `Checkbox`, passing\n      arguments from the helper to `Checkbox`'s `create` method. You can extend the\n      capablilties of checkbox inputs in your applications by reopening this class. For example,\n      if you wanted to add a css class to all checkboxes in your application:\n    \n      ```javascript\n      import Checkbox from '@ember/component/checkbox';\n    \n      Checkbox.reopen({\n        classNames: ['my-app-checkbox']\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      @method input\n      @for Ember.Templates.helpers\n      @param {Hash} options\n      @public\n    */\n

guide](https://emberjs.com/guides/templates/the-application-template/) for\n      additional information on using `{{outlet}}` in `application.hbs`.\n      You may also specify a name for the

```app/routes/menu.js\n      import Route from '@ember/routing/route';\n    \n      export default Route.extend({\n        renderTemplate() {\n          this.render({ outlet: 'menu' });\n        }\n

Ember.js that is compatible with a subset of the [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) syntax.\n    \n      ### Showing a property\n    \n      Templates manage the flow of an application's UI, and display state (through\n      the DOM) to a user. For example, given a component with the property \"name\",\n      that component's template can use the name in several ways:\n    \n      ```app/components/person-profile.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n    \n      export default Component.extend({\n        name: 'Jill'\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      ```app/components/person-profile.hbs\n      {{name}}\n      <div>{{name}}</div>\n      <span data-name={{name}}></span>\n      ```\n    \n      Any time the \"name\" property on the component changes, the DOM will be\n      updated.\n    \n      Properties can be chained as well:\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{aUserModel.name}}\n      <div>{{listOfUsers.firstObject.name}}</div>\n      ```\n    \n      ### Using Ember helpers\n    \n      When content is passed in mustaches `{{}}`, Ember will first try to find a helper\n      or component with that name. For example, the `if` helper:\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{if name \"I have a name\" \"I have no name\"}}\n      <span data-has-name={{if name true}}></span>\n      ```\n    \n      The returned value is placed where the `{{}}` is called. The above style is\n      called \"inline\". A second style of helper usage is called \"block\". For example:\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{#if name}}\n      I have a name\n      {{else}}\n      I have no name\n      {{/if}}\n      ```\n    \n      The block form of helpers allows you to control how the UI is created based\n      on the values of properties.\n      A third form of helper is called \"nested\". For example here the concat\n      helper will add \" Doe\" to a displayed name if the person has no last name:\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      <span data-name={{concat firstName (\n      if lastName (concat \" \" lastName) \"Doe\"\n      )}}></span>\n      ```\n    \n      Ember's built-in helpers are described under the [Ember.Templates.helpers](/api/ember/release/classes/Ember.Templates.helpers)\n      namespace. Documentation on creating custom helpers can be found under\n      [Helper](/api/classes/Ember.Helper.html).\n    \n      ### Invoking a Component\n    \n      Ember components represent state to the UI of an application. Further\n      reading on components can be found under [Component](/api/ember/release/classes/Component).\n    \n      @module @ember/component\n      @main @ember/component\n      @public\n     */\n    /**\n     @module ember\n     @class Ember.Templates.helpers\n     @public\n     */\n    /**\n      Use the `{{with}}` helper when you want to alias a property to a new name. This is helpful\n      for semantic clarity as it allows you to retain default scope or to reference a property from another\n      `{{with}}` block.\n    \n      If the aliased property is \"falsey\", for example: `false`, `undefined` `null`, `\"\"`, `0`, `NaN` or\n      an empty array, the block will not be rendered.\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{! Will only render if user.posts contains items}}\n      {{#with user.posts as |blogPosts|}}\n        <div class=\"notice\">\n          There are {{blogPosts.length}} blog posts written by {{user.name}}.\n        </div>\n        {{#each blogPosts as |post|}}\n          <li>{{post.title}}</li>\n        {{/each}}\n      {{/with}}\n      ```\n    \n      NOTE: The alias should not reuse a name from the bound property path.\n    \n      For example: `{{#with foo.bar as |foo|}}` is not supported because it attempts to alias using\n      the first part of the property path, `foo`. Instead, use `{{#with foo.bar as |baz|}}`.\n    \n      @method with\n      @for Ember.Templates.helpers\n      @param {Object} options\n      @return {String} HTML string\n      @public\n     */\n    /**\n      `{{yield}}` denotes an area of a template that will be rendered inside\n      of another template.\n    \n      ### Use with `Component`\n    \n      When designing components `{{yield}}` is used to denote where, inside the component's\n      template, an optional block passed to the component should render:\n    \n      ```app/templates/application.hbs\n      {{#labeled-textfield value=someProperty}}\n        First name:\n      {{/labeled-textfield}}\n      ```\n    \n      ```app/templates/components/labeled-textfield.hbs\n      <label>\n        {{yield}} {{input value=value}}\n      </label>\n      ```\n    \n      Result:\n    \n      ```html\n      <label>\n        First name: <input type=\"text\" />\n      </label>\n      ```\n    \n      Additionally you can `yield` properties into the context for use by the consumer:\n    \n      ```app/templates/application.hbs\n      {{#labeled-textfield value=someProperty validator=(action 'firstNameValidator') as |validationError|}}\n        {{#if validationError}}\n          <p class=\"error\">{{validationError}}</p>\n        {{/if}}\n        First name:\n      {{/labeled-textfield}}\n      ```\n    \n      ```app/templates/components/labeled-textfield.hbs\n      <label>\n        {{yield validationError}} {{input value=value}}\n      </label>\n      ```\n    \n      Result:\n    \n      ```html\n      <label>\n        <p class=\"error\">First Name must be at least 3 characters long.</p>\n        First name: <input type=\"text\" />\n      </label>\n      ```\n      @method yield\n      @for Ember.Templates.helpers\n      @param {Hash} options\n      @return {String} HTML string\n      @public\n     */\n    /**\n      Execute the `debugger` statement in the current template's context.\n    \n      ```handlebars\n      {{debugger}}\n      ```\n    \n      When using the debugger helper you will have access to a `get` function. This\n      function retrieves values available in the context of the template.\n      For example, if you're wondering why a value `{{foo}}` isn't rendering as\n      expected within a template, you could place a `{{debugger}}` statement and,\n      when the `debugger;` breakpoint is hit, you can attempt to retrieve this value:\n    \n      ```\n      > get('foo')\n      ```\n    \n      `get` is also aware of keywords.

The `fullName` getter function\n    will be called once (regardless of how many times it is accessed) as long\n    as its dependencies have not changed.

You can also be notified whenever the\n    membership of an array changes by using `.observes('myArray.[]')`.\n  \n    To support `EmberArray` in your own class, you must override two\n    primitives to use it: `length()` and `objectAt()`.\n  \n    @class EmberArray\n    @uses Enumerable\n    @since Ember 0.9.0\n    @public\n  */\n  var ArrayMixin = _emberMetal.Mixin.create(_enumerable.default, (_Mixin$create = {}, _Mixin$create[EMBER_ARRAY] = true, _Mixin$create.length = null, _Mixin$create.objectAt = function (idx) {\n    if (idx < 0 || idx >= (0, _emberMetal.get)(this, 'length')) {\n      return undefined;\n    }\n\n    return (0, _emberMetal.get)(this, idx);\n  }, _Mixin$create.objectsAt = function (indexes) {\n    var _this = this;\n\n    return indexes.map(function (idx) {\n      return (0, _emberMetal.objectAt)(_this, idx);\n    });\n  }, _Mixin$create['[]'] = (0, _emberMetal.computed)({\n    get: function () {\n      // eslint-disable-line no-unused-vars\n      return this;\n    },\n    set: function (key, value) {\n      this.replace(0, (0, _emberMetal.get)(this, 'length'), value);\n      return this;\n    }\n  }), _Mixin$create.firstObject = (0, _emberMetal.computed)(function () {\n    return (0, _emberMetal.objectAt)(this, 0);\n  }).readOnly(), _Mixin$create.lastObject = (0, _emberMetal.computed)(function () {\n    return (0, _emberMetal.objectAt)(this, (0, _emberMetal.get)(this, 'length') - 1);\n  }).readOnly(), _Mixin$create.slice = function (beginIndex, endIndex) {\n    var ret = A();\n    var length = (0, _emberMetal.get)(this, 'length');\n\n    if ((0, _emberMetal.isNone)(beginIndex)) {\n      beginIndex = 0;\n    } else if (beginIndex < 0) {\n      beginIndex = length + beginIndex;\n    }\n\n    if ((0, _emberMetal.isNone)(endIndex) || endIndex > length) {\n      endIndex = length;\n    } else if (endIndex < 0) {\n      endIndex = length + endIndex;\n    }\n\n    while (beginIndex < endIndex) {\n      ret[ret.length] = (0, _emberMetal.objectAt)(this, beginIndex++);\n    }\n\n    return ret;\n  }, _Mixin$create.indexOf = function (object, startAt) {\n    var len = (0, _emberMetal.get)(this, 'length'),\n        idx;\n\n    if (startAt === undefined) {\n      startAt = 0;\n    }\n\n    if (startAt < 0) {\n      startAt += len;\n    }\n\n    for (idx = startAt; idx < len; idx++) {\n      if ((0, _emberMetal.objectAt)(this, idx) === object) {\n        return idx;\n      }\n    }\n\n    return -1;\n  }, _Mixin$create.lastIndexOf = function (object, startAt) {\n    var len = (0, _emberMetal.get)(this, 'length'),\n        idx;\n\n    if (startAt === undefined || startAt >= len) {\n      startAt = len - 1;\n    }\n\n    if (startAt < 0) {\n      startAt += len;\n    }\n\n    for (idx = startAt; idx >= 0; idx--) {\n      if ((0, _emberMetal.objectAt)(this, idx) === object) {\n        return idx;\n      }\n    }\n\n    return -1;\n  }, _Mixin$create.addArrayObserver = function (target, opts) {\n    return addArrayObserver(this, target, opts);\n  }, _Mixin$create.removeArrayObserver = function (target, opts) {\n    return removeArrayObserver(this, target, opts);\n  }, _Mixin$create.hasArrayObservers = (0, _emberMetal.computed)(function () {\n    return (0, _emberMetal.hasListeners)(this, '@array:change') || (0, _emberMetal.hasListeners)(this, '@array:before');\n  }), _Mixin$create.arrayContentWillChange = function (startIdx, removeAmt, addAmt) {\n    return arrayContentWillChange(this, startIdx, removeAmt, addAmt);\n  }, _Mixin$create.arrayContentDidChange = function (startIdx, removeAmt, addAmt) {\n    return arrayContentDidChange(this, startIdx, removeAmt, addAmt);\n  }, _Mixin$create.forEach = function (callback) {\n    var target = arguments.length > 1 && arguments[1] !== undefined ?

This is useful for those times when you need to\n      implement a property that is composed of one or more member\n      properties.\n       ### Unknown Properties\n       If you try to set a value on a key that is undefined in the target\n      object, then the `setUnknownProperty()` handler will be called instead. This\n      gives you an opportunity to implement complex \"virtual\" properties that\n      are not predefined on the object. If `setUnknownProperty()` returns\n      undefined, then `set()` will simply set the value on the object.\n       ### Property Observers\n       In addition to changing the property, `set()` will also register a property\n      change with the object.

The `key` is the property that\n      changes. The `value` property is currently reserved and unused. The `rev`\n      is the last property revision of the object when it changed, which you can\n      use to detect if the key value has really changed or not.\n       Usually you will not need the value or revision parameters at\n      the end. In this case, it is common to write observer methods that take\n      only a sender and key value as parameters or, if you aren't interested in\n      any of these values, to write an observer that has no parameters at all.\n       @method addObserver\n      @param {String} key The key to observe\n      @param {Object} target The target object to invoke\n      @param {String|Function} method The method to invoke\n      @return {Observable}\n      @public\n    */\n    addObserver: function (key, target, method) {\n      (0, _emberMetal.addObserver)(this, key, target, method);\n      return this;\n    },\n\n    /**\n      Remove an observer you have previously registered on this object.

The\n    primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n    registers callbacks to receive either a promise’s eventual value or the reason\n    why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n  \n    Terminology\n    -----------\n  \n    - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n    - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n    - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n    - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n    - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n    - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n  \n    A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n  \n    Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n    state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n    rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n  \n    Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n    promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n    settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n    itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n    itself fulfill.\n  \n  \n    Basic Usage:\n    ------------\n  \n    ```js\n    let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n      // on success\n      resolve(value);\n  \n      // on failure\n      reject(reason);\n    });\n  \n    promise.then(function(value) {\n      // on fulfillment\n    }, function(reason) {\n      // on rejection\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Advanced Usage:\n    ---------------\n  \n    Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n    `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n  \n    ```js\n    function getJSON(url) {\n      return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n        let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n  \n        xhr.open('GET', url);\n        xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n        xhr.responseType = 'json';\n        xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n        xhr.send();\n  \n        function handler() {\n          if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n            if (this.status === 200) {\n              resolve(this.response);\n            } else {\n              reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n            }\n          }\n        };\n      });\n    }\n  \n    getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n      // on fulfillment\n    }, function(reason) {\n      // on rejection\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n  \n    ```js\n    Promise.all([\n      getJSON('/posts'),\n      getJSON('/comments')\n    ]).then(function(values){\n      values[0] // => postsJSON\n      values[1] // => commentsJSON\n  \n      return values;\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    @class RSVP.Promise\n    @param {function} resolver\n    @param {String} label optional string for labeling the promise.\n    Useful for tooling.\n    @constructor\n  */\n\n  var Promise = function () {\n    function Promise(resolver, label) {\n\n      this._id = counter++;\n      this._label = label;\n      this._state = undefined;\n      this._result = undefined;\n      this._subscribers = [];\n\n      config.instrument && instrument('created', this);\n\n      if (noop !== resolver) {\n        typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();\n        this instanceof Promise ?

You can use `denodeify` in Node.js or the\n    browser when you'd prefer to use promises over using callbacks. For example,\n    `denodeify` transforms the following:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let fs = require('fs');\n  \n    fs.readFile('myfile.txt', function(err, data){\n      if (err) return handleError(err);\n      handleData(data);\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    into:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let fs = require('fs');\n    let readFile = RSVP.denodeify(fs.readFile);\n  \n    readFile('myfile.txt').then(handleData, handleError);\n    ```\n  \n    If the node function has multiple success parameters, then `denodeify`\n    just returns the first one:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let request = RSVP.denodeify(require('request'));\n  \n    request('http://example.com').then(function(res) {\n      // ...\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    However, if you need all success parameters, setting `denodeify`'s\n    second parameter to `true` causes it to return all success parameters\n    as an array:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let request = RSVP.denodeify(require('request'), true);\n  \n    request('http://example.com').then(function(result) {\n      // result[0] -> res\n      // result[1] -> body\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Or if you pass it an array with names it returns the parameters as a hash:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let request = RSVP.denodeify(require('request'), ['res', 'body']);\n  \n    request('http://example.com').then(function(result) {\n      // result.res\n      // result.body\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Sometimes you need to retain the `this`:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let app = require('express')();\n    let render = RSVP.denodeify(app.render.bind(app));\n    ```\n  \n    The denodified function inherits from the original function. It works in all\n    environments, except IE 10 and below. Consequently all properties of the original\n    function are available to you. However, any properties you change on the\n    denodeified function won't be changed on the original function. Example:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let request = RSVP.denodeify(require('request')),\n        cookieJar = request.jar(); // <- Inheritance is used here\n  \n    request('http://example.com', {jar: cookieJar}).then(function(res) {\n      // cookieJar.cookies holds now the cookies returned by example.com\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Using `denodeify` makes it easier to compose asynchronous operations instead\n    of using callbacks. For example, instead of:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let fs = require('fs');\n  \n    fs.readFile('myfile.txt', function(err, data){\n      if (err) { ... } // Handle error\n      fs.writeFile('myfile2.txt', data, function(err){\n        if (err) { ... } // Handle error\n        console.log('done')\n      });\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    you can chain the operations together using `then` from the returned promise:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let fs = require('fs');\n    let readFile = RSVP.denodeify(fs.readFile);\n    let writeFile = RSVP.denodeify(fs.writeFile);\n  \n    readFile('myfile.txt').then(function(data){\n      return writeFile('myfile2.txt', data);\n    }).then(function(){\n      console.log('done')\n    }).catch(function(error){\n      // Handle error\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    @method denodeify\n    @static\n    @for RSVP\n    @param {Function} nodeFunc a 'node-style' function that takes a callback as\n    its last argument.

For example,\n    say you want to get all comments from a set of blog posts, but you need\n    the blog posts first because they contain a url to those comments.\n  \n    ```javscript\n  \n    let mapFn = function(blogPost){\n      // getComments does some ajax and returns an RSVP.Promise that is fulfilled\n      // with some comments data\n      return getComments(blogPost.comments_url);\n    };\n  \n    // getBlogPosts does some ajax and returns an RSVP.Promise that is fulfilled\n    // with some blog post data\n    RSVP.map(getBlogPosts(), mapFn).then(function(comments){\n      // comments is the result of asking the server for the comments\n      // of all blog posts returned from getBlogPosts()\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    @method map\n    @static\n    @for RSVP\n    @param {Array} promises\n    @param {Function} mapFn function to be called on each fulfilled promise.\n    @param {String} label optional string for labeling the promise.\n    Useful for tooling.\n    @return {Promise} promise that is fulfilled with the result of calling\n    `mapFn` on each fulfilled promise or value when they become fulfilled.\n     The promise will be rejected if any of the given `promises` become rejected.\n    @static\n  */\n  function map(promises, mapFn, label) {\n    if (!Array.isArray(promises)) {\n      return Promise.reject(new TypeError(\"RSVP.map must be called with an array\"), label);\n    }\n\n    if (typeof mapFn !== 'function') {\n      return Promise.reject(new TypeError(\"RSVP.map expects a function as a second argument\"), label);\n    }\n\n    return new MapEnumerator(Promise, promises, mapFn, label).promise;\n  }\n\n  /**\n    This is a convenient alias for `RSVP.Promise.resolve`.\n  \n    @method resolve\n    @static\n    @for RSVP\n    @param {*} value value that the returned promise will be resolved with\n    @param {String} label optional string for identifying the returned promise.\n    Useful for tooling.\n    @return {Promise} a promise that will become fulfilled with the given\n    `value`\n  */\n  function resolve$2(value, label) {\n    return Promise.resolve(value, label);\n  }\n\n  /**\n    This is a convenient alias for `RSVP.Promise.reject`.\n  \n    @method reject\n    @static\n    @for RSVP\n    @param {*} reason value that the returned promise will be rejected with.\n    @param {String} label optional string for identifying the returned promise.\n    Useful for tooling.\n    @return {Promise} a promise rejected with the given `reason`.\n  */\n  function reject$2(reason, label) {\n    return Promise.reject(reason, label);\n  }\n\n  var EMPTY_OBJECT = {};\n\n  var FilterEnumerator = function (_MapEnumerator) {\n    (0, _emberBabel.inherits)(FilterEnumerator, _MapEnumerator);\n\n    function FilterEnumerator() {\n      return (0, _emberBabel.possibleConstructorReturn)(this, _MapEnumerator.apply(this, arguments));\n    }\n\n    FilterEnumerator.prototype._checkFullfillment = function () {\n      var result;\n\n      if (this._remaining === 0 && this._result !== null) {\n        result = this._result.filter(function (val) {\n          return val !== EMPTY_OBJECT;\n        });\n\n        fulfill(this.promise, result);\n        this._result = null;\n      }\n    };\n\n    FilterEnumerator.prototype._setResultAt = function (state, i, value, firstPass) {\n      var val;\n\n      if (firstPass) {\n        this._result[i] = value;\n        val = tryCatch(this._mapFn)(value, i);\n\n        if (val === TRY_CATCH_ERROR) {\n          this._settledAt(REJECTED, i, val.error, false);\n        } else {\n          this._eachEntry(val, i, false);\n        }\n      } else {\n        this._remaining--;\n        if (!value) {\n          this._result[i] = EMPTY_OBJECT;\n        }\n      }\n    };\n\n    return FilterEnumerator;\n  }(MapEnumerator);\n\n  /**\n   `RSVP.filter` is similar to JavaScript's native `filter` method.\n   `filterFn` is eagerly called meaning that as soon as any promise\n    resolves its value will be passed to `filterFn`. `RSVP.filter` returns\n    a promise that will become fulfilled with the result of running\n    `filterFn` on the values the promises become fulfilled with.\n  \n    For example:\n  \n    ```javascript\n  \n    let promise1 = RSVP.resolve(1);\n    let promise2 = RSVP.resolve(2);\n    let promise3 = RSVP.resolve(3);\n  \n    let promises = [promise1, promise2, promise3];\n  \n    let filterFn = function(item){\n      return item > 1;\n    };\n  \n    RSVP.filter(promises, filterFn).then(function(result){\n      // result is [ 2, 3 ]\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    If any of the `promises` given to `RSVP.filter` are rejected, the first promise\n    that is rejected will be given as an argument to the returned promise's\n    rejection handler.
